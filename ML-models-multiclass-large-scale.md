## Machine learning models - large scale multiclassification

In our previous text classification task, we have only 4 classes. However, in real-life, we might need a machine that are able to identify a target among thousands of objects. This is a more challenging task.

Here I am going to present such a use case - job title standardization. We have millions of jobs and thousands of standard job titles, we would like to classify the jobs based on their job title, which is super important for label market analysis for our clients. Here I will demostrate an experiment on this type of classification task.
