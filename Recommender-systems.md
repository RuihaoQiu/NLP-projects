This project will introduce several recommender systems in NLP, specifically in the domain of online recruitment. It includes important ideas behind the recommender systems of our web application, also similar with those in recruiting platform like LinkedIn, Xing.

### Autocomplete
I have already implemented a autocomplete function using Trie structure in one of my previous projects - [Location autocomplete](https://algonotes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Trie.html).

There should be two important part:
- Searching algorithm
