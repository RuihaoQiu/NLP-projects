## Machine learning models

This note contains the code of machine learning models on a specific task - job segmentation. The model can be used to automatic predict which part of the job description, general there are four parts in a typical job description:
- company introduction,
- tasks
- requirements
- benefits

It is a typical classification problem on NLP. And it is super useful in our daily analysis on label market.

The feature engineering have been done, feel free to check the [this notebooks](https://github.com/RuihaoQiu/NLP-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Job_segmentation/Feature_engineering_job_segmentation.ipynb) and the previous chapters. There are three types of features:
- Bag-of-words features: vectorize each text with tfidf-vectorizer and reduce the feature dimension with SVD down to 50 components.
- Text-based statistical features: e.g. word counts, characters counts, punctuation counts ... etc.
- Part of speech features: noun, verb, adj, ...

Here I will only focus on machine learning modelling, which will include model training, evaluation, parameter tuning and model comparison.

**Load data**
```
df_train = pd.read_csv("train_data.csv", index_col=0)
df_test = pd.read_csv("test_data.csv", index_col=0)

def load_data():
    X_train = df_train.drop("label", axis=1)
    y_train = df_train["label"]

    X_test = df_test.drop("label", axis=1)
    y_test = df_test["label"]
    return X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test

X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = load_data()

print(X_train.shape, X_test.shape)
```

### Model selection
Here I will focus on tree-based models and neural networks.

- Decision Tree
```
from sklearn import tree
DTC = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(
    criterion="entropy",
    max_depth=8,
    min_samples_split=10,
    max_features="auto",
    random_state=100
)
DTC.fit(X_train, y_train)
train_score = DTC.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = DTC.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Training accuracy: {0:5.2f}%.\
      \nTesting accuracy: {1:5.2f}%."
      .format(100*train_score, 100*test_score))
```
Training accuracy: 93.34%.<br>
Testing accuracy: 86.59%.

- Random Forest
```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
RFC = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    criterion="entropy",
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_split=10,
    random_state=100,
)
RFC.fit(X_train, y_train)
train_score = RFC.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = RFC.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Training accuracy: {0:5.2f}%.\
      \nTesting accuracy: {1:5.2f}%."
      .format(100*train_score, 100*test_score))
```
Training accuracy: 96.53%.<br>
Testing accuracy: 93.46%.

- Gradient Boosting Tree
```
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
GBC = GradientBoostingClassifier(
    learning_rate=0.1,
    n_estimators=100,
    subsample=0.8,
    max_depth=2,
    random_state=100
)
GBC.fit(X_train, y_train)
train_score = GBC.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = GBC.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Training accuracy: {0:5.2f}%.\
      \nTesting accuracy: {1:5.2f}%."
      .format(100*train_score, 100*test_score))
```
Training accuracy: 99.10%.<br>
Testing accuracy: 95.23%.

- Neural networks

Prepare input
```
# input parameters
label_column = "label"
model_file = "model.h5"
history_file = "history.csv"
stats_file = "stats.cav"

label_dict = {
    "company": 0,
    "tasks": 1,
    "profile": 2,
    "benefits": 3
}

# make stats file for train data for normalizing data
df_stats = df_train.describe().loc[["mean", "std"]].transpose()

def norm(df, train_stats):
    """Normalized based on mean and std of training data

    Args:
        df: input features
        train_stats (df): statistics of train data, from pd.DataFrame.describe function

    Returns:
        Normalized df
    """
    return (df - train_stats['mean']) / train_stats['std']

def make_train_data():
    """make training inputs.

    Return:
        train_data: normilized features
        train_labels: target label
    """
    df_input_pm = df_train.iloc[np.random.permutation(len(df_train))]
    features = df_input_pm.drop(label_column, axis=1)
    train_features_norm = norm(features, df_stats)
    train_label = to_categorical(df_input_pm[label_column].map(label_dict))
    return train_features_norm, train_label

train_data, train_labels = make_train_data()
```
Build model
```
def build_model(X, learning_rate=0.001):
    """Build neural networks model.
    3-layers full-connected model with [16,8,4] neurons each.

    Args:
        X: input features
        learning_rate (float): learning rate of the learning algorithm

    Returns:
        NN: fully connected neural networks model
    """
    NN = Sequential()
    NN.add(Dense(16, activation='relu', input_dim=X.shape[1]))
    NN.add(Dropout(0.2))
    NN.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
    NN.add(Dropout(0.2))
    NN.add(Dense(4, activation='softmax'))

    NN.compile(
        optimizer=SGD(lr=0.005, momentum=0.8),
        loss='categorical_crossentropy',
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )
    return NN

model = build_model(train_data)
```
Training
```
clear_session()

history = model.fit(
    train_data,
    train_labels,
    validation_split = 0.3,
    epochs=1000,
    verbose=3
)
```
Check performance
```
df_history = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
def plot_history(df_history):
    """Plot learning curve for both training and testing data.
    """
    plt.figure()
    plt.xlabel('Epoch')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
    plt.plot(df_history['accuracy'], label='Train Error')
    plt.plot(df_history['val_accuracy'], label = 'Val Error')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

plot_history(df_history)
```

As you can see, it is easy to build models once we have prepared the data. We just need to spend some time on hyper-parameter tuning. More advanced model can largely increase the accuracy. The accuracy is very high now. Let's do further analysis.


### Model evaluation
**Confusion matrix**<br>
One nice way to measure the model accuracy is confusion matrix. Here is the code the plot the heatmap.
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

labels = ["company", "tasks", "profile", "benefits"]
y_pred_train = GBC.predict(X_train)
y_pred_test = GBC.predict(X_test)
cm_train = confusion_matrix(y_train, y_pred_train, labels=labels)
cm_test = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_test, labels=labels)

def plot_confusion_matrix(confusion_matrix, class_names, figsize = (10,7), fontsize=14, cmap=plt.cm.RdBu_r):
    """Prints a confusion matrix as a heatmap.

    Inputs
    ---------
    confusion_matrix: numpy.ndarray
        The numpy.ndarray object returned from a call to sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.
    class_names: list
        An ordered list of class names, in the order they index the given confusion matrix.
    figsize: tuple
    fontsize: int
        Font size for axes labels.

    """
    df_cm = pd.DataFrame(
        confusion_matrix, index=class_names, columns=class_names,
    )
    cmap = sns.diverging_palette(240, 10, as_cmap=True)
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)
    try:
        heatmap = sns.heatmap(df_cm, annot=True, center==0, fmt="d", cmap=cmap)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Confusion matrix values must be integers.")
    heatmap.yaxis.set_ticklabels(heatmap.yaxis.get_ticklabels(), rotation=0, ha='right', fontsize=fontsize)
    heatmap.xaxis.set_ticklabels(heatmap.xaxis.get_ticklabels(), rotation=45, ha='right', fontsize=fontsize)
    plt.ylabel('True label', fontsize=fontsize)
    plt.xlabel('Predicted label', fontsize=fontsize)
```
- Confusion matrix for training set
```
plot_confusion_matrix(confusion_matrix=cm_train, class_names=labels)
```
![train](plots/confusion_matrix_heatmap_train.png)

- Confusion matrix for testing set
```
plot_confusion_matrix(confusion_matrix=cm_test, class_names=labels)
```
![test](plots/confusion_matrix_heatmap_test.png)

I will discuss model evaluation in a separated chapter, since it is important to select the right measurement for a machine learning problem.
